I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of Rochester advised by Prof. [Jiebo Luo](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/). My work lies in Computational Linguistics and Social Media, with a primary focus on the algorithmic and theoretical foundations for solving financial application scenario problems.
